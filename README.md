Escape The Maze is a challenging maze game. The objective is simple, escape the maze.
- The unperdictable and maze like structure of the map forces the player to think through their everymove
- The sporadically moving cells in the maze, will end the player on contact. Do not lose hope though, they are blind.
- You tiny source of light does not follow the same system of movement as the player, forcing them to think out side of the box to navigate the dark maze
- Escape the maze to recive your score!

HOW TO PLAY
- Use WASD to move the player and the light
	- The light can go through walls but you can't
- Avoid the enemy cells, if you touch them, you're out
- The walls are sticky, use that to your advantage
	- To unstick from the wall, move in the perpendicular direction

Special Features

- Use the light to scout the path ahead, but be warned, you will move at the same time!
